It is no secret that the relationship between the Plone world (and I imagine the same stands for a large part of the rest of the python world) and javascript is bumpy to say the least. Javascript is considered inferior, ugly, dirty, a scripting language that is an unfortunate necessity. Typically this happens due to these reasons:

* Javascript has been so misused that the web is ridden with bad examples and anti-patterns. Most of us (and I will not exclude myself, at least in the past) have copy-pasted bad examples without ever questioning them or putting the extra effort to understand and find better ways. The good thing is that this is now changing, frameworks exist and they are well documented, and there is now a plethora of good developers who actually are proud and actively advertise being javascript developers.
* It is actually *hard* to see the nice parts of javascript. This is especially true if you don't even try and it is also true that calling something a "self-invoking anonymous function" does not help. But hey, they do exist. Closures are nice. Functions and prototypes are nice. The functional parts of javascript are nice. And a lot of the frameworks that are around nowadays have patterns that manage to be both simple and powerful.
* Purism. The eternal battle of the server vs. client and how curly brackets are so unecessary. Oh well, I think I will pass on this one.
