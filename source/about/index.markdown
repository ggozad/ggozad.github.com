**A few words about me:**

I am an ex-physicist who quit academia for software development a long time ago ;) At present I mostly work with python and javascript, building (typically large) apps for the web. I have a number of contributions in the open-source world which I consider *home*, and am currently a [Plone](http://plone.org) code developer and member of the Framework Team.

I live in TÃ¸nsberg, Norway with my family and proudly work for [Jarn AS](http://jarn.com).
You can contact me by mail at *ggozad _the_usual_ jarn.com*,  on [twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/ggozad), or ping me on irc (ggozad on #freenode).
